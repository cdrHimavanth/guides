FIrst we need to have jenkins.war file
and to run it we require java 11 as minimum 
but we may have different version set in environment variables
so we open terminal and use set PATH=urpath;%PATH% to set path for that terminal
after that run using java -jar name.war --httpPort=9090 some port u desire to run it on or it will take default port


it will give a default admin password in teminal initially
we open in localhost and login with pass from terminal 
cerate a new admin user and enjoy
